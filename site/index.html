		Programming languages that is ubiquitous: 
	</section>
	<ul>
		<li> C++ </li>
		<li> Python </li>
		<li> Java </li>
		<li> Web development:
			<ol>
				<li> HTML </li>
				<li> CSS </li>
				<li> JS </li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li> Kotlin
	</ul>

		Here's some basic inequality:
		<ol>
			<li> x<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0 </li>
			<li> GM &lt; AM </li>
			<li> x<sup>2</sup> is larger than both zero &amp; negative numbers.</li>
		</ol>
		These inequalities are helpful to keep in mind. They could get very difficult especially when the variables get too big in power, or the constraint function given is rather unsual and difficult to utilise. Therefore it is vital to remember most of the useful substitution such as Ravi&nbsp;substitution that can help us to deal with some of the constraint functions more effectively. Hopefully this will help.

	<footer>There shouldn't be any &copy; issues here, and there should be a non-breaking space for the phrase Ravi substitution.</footer>
